Welcome to the GNUstep Examples directory.

In this directory there is a full collection of examples for the GNUstep
libraries.  Some tests are very old, other are newer; some are 
up-to-date, other are not.

Quick start to compile and run the tests:

make
openapp ./testYouWantToSee.app

For more information, see the README file associated with each subdirectory.
Currently there is only one, for gui tests.
