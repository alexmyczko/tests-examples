Welcome to the GNUstep Testing directory.

In this directory there is a full collection of tests for the GNUstep
GUI libraries.  Some tests are very old, other are newer; some are 
up-to-date, other are not.

Important Note: the currently maintained and supported examples are:

GSTest, Finger, Calculator, CurrencyConverter, Ink and NSPanelTest.

If they misbehave, please report it as a bug to bug-gnustep@gnu.org.

A rearrangement is under way to make more clear that other
examples/test are old and/or not supported.

Quick start to compile and run the tests:

make
openapp testYouWantToSee.app

If this tip is not enough, read on for the detailed explanations.

COMPILING THE TESTS
-------------------
To compile all the tests, simple type: 

make

To compile only a specifical test, for example popupbuttons.app, 
you have to type:

make popupbuttons

Compiling a test called "testName" creates a directory called 
"testName.app".  
For example, when compiling the popupbuttons test, the directory 
popupbuttons.app is created.  

RUNNING THE TESTS
-----------------
To run a test, launch openapp with the test .app directory [see 
"COMPILING THE TESTS" above] as argument.  
For example, to run the popupbuttons.app test, type

openapp popupbuttons.app

Some bigger tests have a directory of their own, so that to run 
the Calculator.app test you have to type:

cd Calculator
openapp Calculator.app

[or, in a single command, type "openapp Calculator/Calculator.app"]
