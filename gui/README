Welcome to the GNUstep Testing directory.

In this directory there is a full collection of tests for the GNUstep
GUI libraries.  

Tests are kept in subdirectories.

Quick start to compile and run the tests:

make
cd testYouWantToSee
openapp testYouWantToSee.app

If this tip is not enough, read on for the detailed explanations.

COMPILING THE TESTS
-------------------
To compile all the tests, simple type: 

make

To compile a single test, go into its directory, then type 'make' there. 
Compiling a test called "testName" creates a directory called 
"testName.app".  
For example, when compiling the CurrencyConverter test, the directory 
CurrencyConverter.app is created.  

RUNNING THE TESTS
-----------------
To run a test, launch openapp with the test .app directory [see 
"COMPILING THE TESTS" above] as argument.  
For example, to run the CurrencyConverter.app test, type

cd CurrencyConverter
openapp CurrencyConverter.app

[or, in a single command, type 
"openapp CurrencyConverter/CurrencyConverter.app"]
